1. Development workflow:
   - With Docker Compose, you can use `docker-compose up` to start your development environment and `docker-compose down` to stop it.
   - Remember that changes to your Python code will be reflected immediately due to the volume mapping in your docker-compose file, but changes to your Dockerfile or installed dependencies will require rebuilding the image.

2. Database management:
   - You can use Django's management commands through Docker. For example:
     ```
     docker-compose run web python manage.py makemigrations
     docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate
     ```

3. Creating a superuser:
   - To access the Django admin interface, you'll need a superuser:
     ```
     docker-compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```

4. Security:
   - Remember to keep your `SECRET_KEY` and database password secure. Consider using environment variables for sensitive information in production.

5. Performance:
   - For production, you might want to use a more performant web server like Gunicorn instead of the Django development server.

6. Static files:
   - Don't forget to set up static file serving for production. You might want to look into using Django's `collectstatic` command and a web server like Nginx to serve static files.

7. Backups:
   - Implement a backup strategy for your database. Docker volumes can be backed up, or you can use PostgreSQL's built-in backup tools.

8. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
   - Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment of your application.
